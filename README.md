# Scheduler-for-workday-homework 
## Description
The motivation behind this assignment, which required creating a color-coded workday calendar that is responsive based on the time of day, is to increase my ability to use Javascript and I strongly believe that I benefited the most in doing that, in completing this assignment. I built this project in order to see what was necessary in building a responsive and organized website, that can automatically adjust its colors based on the time of day. And the problem that it solved,as a result of what I learned, is that I realized how important it is to create an outline of what is needed to make the website function as intended, and then literally, go line by line of what code you want to implement in order to make it happen.

## Installation
Firstly, I have to place my work onto Github. In order to install the work onto Github, firstly you have to create an account. Then you have to create a new repository and give it a name. Be sure to make this new repository public and add a readme. Once that is done, there will be a green button, and once clicked, clone will be at the top with three options underneath. Click the ssh option. And then copy the link. Then go to the terminal. open the directory (type in ls) and then change into the specific directory (type in cd and the name of the directory) that you would like to place this project. Then you have to run a git add . command, followed by, a git commit -m "enter description of changes made" command. Then lastly run a git push command to publish the project onto Github.
